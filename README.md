# 🎵 Predicting the Beats-per-Minute of Songs (Kaggle Playground S5E9)

This project uses regression models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) to predict song BPM.

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & EDA  
2. Feature Engineering  
3. Model Training and Evaluation (RMSE metric)  
4. Submission file generation  

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle Playground S5E9 Dataset

## Results
Best model: 'xyz'
RMSE ≈ *xyz*

## Files
- `bpm_prediction.ipynb`: Full notebook  
- `submission.csv`: Kaggle submission file
